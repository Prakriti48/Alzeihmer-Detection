ðŸ§  Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Detection
This project aims to detect Alzheimerâ€™s disease using machine learning techniques.
It processes patient data, applies preprocessing pipelines, and trains predictive models to classify Alzheimerâ€™s presence based on medical and demographic features.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
alzeihmer_detectionipynb.ipynb â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing all code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

alzheimers_disease_data.csv â€“ Dataset containing patient information and Alzheimerâ€™s diagnosis labels (not included here for privacy).

ðŸš€ Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing:

Removal of irrelevant columns (PatientID, DoctorInCharge).

Identification of numerical and categorical features.

Scaling and encoding using MinMaxScaler / StandardScaler.

Model Training:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Model Evaluation:

Accuracy score

Classification Report

Confusion Matrix Visualization

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python 3

Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ Visualization

Scikit-learn â€“ Machine Learning models & preprocessing

ðŸ“Š Workflow
Import Libraries â€“ Load all required dependencies.

Load Dataset â€“ Read Alzheimerâ€™s disease dataset from CSV.

Preprocess Data â€“ Handle categorical and numerical columns.

Split Data â€“ Train-test split for model evaluation.

Train Models â€“ Logistic Regression & Random Forest.

Evaluate Models â€“ Compare performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.

ðŸ“ˆ Results
The models are evaluated to determine the best-performing classifier for Alzheimerâ€™s prediction.

Metrics like accuracy and classification report help in model comparison.
